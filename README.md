# Binary Star System Data (CS289A Project S Early)
This is a dataset for a fictional universe - a binary star system. There are two "suns", one "Earth" and one "moon" in this system. Two "suns" are orbiting each other in a cirlce, with a diameter of 0.2 AU. The mass of each fictional "sun" is half of the real sun mass. The fictional "Earth" ("moon") orbit is set to be close to the real Earth (moon) orbit as much as possible. All orbits are in the same plane. The time zero is when four planets are collinear, while the "Earth" is at perihelion and the "moon" is at apogee.

## Data Format
Our data consists of two parts:

1. Trajectories of the two suns, the Earth and the moon over a 10-year span.
2. Observations of the two suns and the moon from the Earth.

### Trajectories
Trajectories are generated by 4-body simulation using Mathematica. The positions of all four planets are presented in a cartesian coordinate system, whose origin coincides with the mass center of the two suns. All dynamics are within xy-plane. We also include z-axis data, which should be all zero, in case people want to include z-axis motion in future. The data are stored in "/trajectories/coordinates_evolution.csv". Time is in the units of seconds, while coordinates are in the units of meters. The data file has the following formats:

|Time|Sun1_x|Sun1_y|Sun1_z|Sun2_x|Sun2_y|Sun2_z|earth_x|earth_y|earth_z|moon_x|moon_y|moon_z|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|...|

### Observations
There are three datasets: 1_Berkeley.rar, 2_Shanghai.rar, and 3_Sydney.rar. In each of these compressed file, you will find four files: Moon.dat, Sun_A.dat, Sun_B.dat, and local_pos_on_earth.png.

These datasets are named after the location of the observer. For example, 2_Shanghai contains data observed by an observer whose location is roughly at Shanghai, China. The exact longitude and latitude information of the observer can be found in local_pos_on_earth.png.

There is also a text file called Raw_picture_data.txt, which contains a Google Drive link. In the Google Drive, the New Data.rar contains all the raw picture data we used to generate the above mentioned information.

#### local_pos_on_earth
The local_pos_on_earth.png file contains the information of the observer's location on earth, including the latitude and longtitude.

#### Sun_A, Sun_B
Sun_A.dat and Sun_B.dat contains the observation information of the two stars SunA and SunB in our binary star solar system.
For each file, the record follows the format below:
Figure index, Time, Direction(azimuthal angle), Height(polar angle), Apparent size

1. Figure index indicates the corresponding figure for generating this line of data.
2. Time is the absolute time in our fictional universe(No time zone difference).
3. Direction is the azimuthal angle of the Sun observed from the given location in spherical coordinates.
4. Height is the polar angle of the Sun observed from the given location in spherical coordinates.

For Time, the format in the file is: year month day hour minute second   
For Direction, Height, and Apparent size, the format in the file is: degree minute second   

#### Moon
The format is the same as that of Sun_A.dat and Sun_B.dat except that there is an additional data column recording the phase of moon.
The phase of moon should be a number between 0 and 1. However, due to the not high recognition rate of the Optical Character Recognition(OCR) package we are using, this column contains some invalid data.

#### How to generate the data
In order to generate the data, one needs to follow the following steps:
1. Download the New Data.rar from the Google Drive link in the Raw_picture_data.txt under the data folder on Github.
2. Unzip the New Data.rar file and there will be three folders: 1_Berkeley, 2_Shanghai, and 3_Sydney. In each of these three folders, there will be three subfolders: Moon, Sun A, and Sun B.
3. Copy the three ipynb files Moon.ipynb, Sun A.ipynb, and Sun B.ipynb to all three folders mentioned in step 2. The ipynb files can be found under code folder on Github.
4. In 1_Berkeley folder, run Moon.ipynb, Sun A.ipynb, and Sun B.ipynb and you will get the Moon.dat, Sun_A.dat, and Sun_B.dat data files corresponding to the observation at Berkeley. (Notice: this may take an hour to complete running on a gaming laptop!)
5. In 2_Shanghai folder, run Moon.ipynb, Sun A.ipynb, and Sun B.ipynb and you will get the Moon.dat, Sun_A.dat, and Sun_B.dat data files corresponding to the observation at Shanghai. (Notice: this may take an hour to complete running on a gaming laptop!)
6. In 3_Sydney folder, run Moon.ipynb, Sun A.ipynb, and Sun B.ipynb and you will get the Moon.dat, Sun_A.dat, and Sun_B.dat data files corresponding to the observation at Sydney. (Notice: this may take an hour to complete running on a gaming laptop!)
